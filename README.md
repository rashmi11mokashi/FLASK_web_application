# FLASK_web_application

1. Flask Setup & Installation
Flask is installed to create and manage a web application. A virtual environment is set up to isolate project dependencies from the system environment, ensuring a clean workspace for the app.

2.Creating a Flask App
The core app file (e.g., main.py) initializes a Flask instance, which acts as the central object to manage the web application. Routes are defined to specify URLs and their corresponding functions.

3.Creating Routes/Views
Routes link specific URLs to Python functions, defining what the app should display or do when a user visits a particular page.

4.Jinja Templating Language & HTML Templates
Jinja allows dynamic content generation in HTML files using variables and logic directly from the Flask app. Templates are stored in the templates/ directory for Flask to locate and render them.

5.Sign Up Page HTML
A signup form is designed to allow users to create accounts. This page collects user details, which are processed by the Flask app when submitted.

6.Login Page HTML
The login page provides a form for users to authenticate by entering their credentials. It connects to a backend function to validate user data.
